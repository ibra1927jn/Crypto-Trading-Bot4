# Progress Log

## 2026-03-30 — Heartbeat Maintenance Cycle

### Test Coverage Improvements
- Added test for successful model load path in `AI_Predictor._load_model()` (saves model, loads it, verifies eval mode)
- Added test for insufficient data after `dropna` in `AI_Predictor.predict()` (data passes initial length check but fails after NaN removal)
- Added test for Bollinger signal exception handler when `close` column is missing

### Results
- **Tests**: 123/123 passing (was 120/120)
- **Coverage**: 99% (was 98%) — `ai_predictor.py` and `indicators.py` both at 100%
- **Lint**: clean (ruff, all checks passed)
- **Build**: clean

### Notes
- Pre-commit hook blocks all commits touching `src/config.py` due to overly broad `API_KEY\s*=\s*\S+` pattern matching `os.getenv()` calls. The redundant `defaultType = 'future'` assignment on line 126 was identified but could not be committed without `--no-verify`.
